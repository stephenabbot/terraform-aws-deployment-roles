These instructions are to be followed when ask to quash teh git commit history and push it to the remote repo so what is published and visible from the public git repository is the code only and not the development history

please quash all git history into a single initial commit message and force push the main branch to the remote repo so that there is only a single main branch with teh single initial commit. the intent is to shrink the project to the bare minimum size and also delete all the git history except for the one commit 'ini
tial commit'
